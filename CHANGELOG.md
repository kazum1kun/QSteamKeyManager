* After some serious researching and digging QSKM can now reads from a sqlite-based database! 
* Not only that, it also shows the data in an interesting... table. Yes, a table differing from the prototype. Guess you don't care, anyways.
* The table is editable and sortable. Right now the editing is kinda wonky and need further working on it.
    - Right now edits will be automatically saved to the database when you click away from the row.

## December 8, 2018

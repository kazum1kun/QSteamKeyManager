A simple PyQt-based tool that allows you to manage your unused Steam keys and redemption URLs with ease. Functionality-wise similar to my previous project, [Steam Key Manager](https://github.com/l19980623/SteamKeyManager) but rewritten in Python and Qt framework (powered by [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)).  

No preview release is available as of yet. Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting Pull Requests or leaving comments. Thank you!

## Intro 
Do you have a lot of leftover keys from all that bundles but wonder what you can do with them? No worries, QSteamKeyManager (QSKM) is here to help you! With QSKM you can record, modify, and delete keys and URLs in an intuitive UI. You can also tag and categorize keys and see the corresponding game in the store. All data are stored in a database, making them less vulnerable to tampering.

## Functions
As of now, QSKM is only a skeleton and do not provide much functionalities. The following additions and improvements are being worked on:
- Add/Remove entries to the table (50% done/being worked on)
- Add notes to entries (done)
- Edit an entry (done)
- Sort the list (done)
- Search for anything in the table (done)
- See a game in Steam (being worked on)
- Copy key to the system clipboard
- Import keys from an existing text file
- Save the table to sql file (done)
- Multi-language support
- Tag and categorize entries
- Encrypt local storage
